Image processing project
The project on image processing is based upon the most recent and trending craze among the youngsters which is of applying filters to their pictures before posting them elsewhere on various social networking sites. This graphical user interface project allows the user to insert an image in the .jpg format. The size range of the image can be 300*400 pixel. 
Thereafter the user gets the choice to select from a wide variety of filters available like increasing and decreasing the brightness or increasing the edge and to enhance their image quality. The various available filters are similar to the ones we come across on social networking sites.
